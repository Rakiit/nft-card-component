### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live site on Netlify](https://rakiit-nft-card-component.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project I learned how to create an image overlay icon with the pseudo class hover which I think was the hardest part to complete.

### Continued development

I would like to learn Flexbox, and pseudo classes more in depth. As a person who is starting I found quite difficult to came up with a complete solution by myself, but I manage to do a lot of things as well so I think I just need more practice to master this :D.

### Useful resources

- [Styles for <hr>'s](https://css-tricks.com/examples/hrs/) - This other resource helped me with the styling of the hr that the card has.
